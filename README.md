Step 1: Uploading and reading Data

	-Import libraries

Step 2: Clean Data
	
	-Check for null values 
	-Data types

Step 3 :Step 3: Visualize Data

	-Pie graph for column distribution 
	-Bar graph for class distribution in columns
	-Histogram for quantitative variables
	-Check correlations

Step 4: Splitting Data into Training and Testing sets (including encoding of qualitative variables)

	-Encoding target variable
	-Creating dummy variables for qualitiative variables (dependent and independent)
	-Stratified train-test split

Step 5: Step 5 Determining Fraud vs.non fraud distribution with different models, and evaluating the accuracy
	
	-Import modules
	-Evaluation functions 
	-Evaluate model (SVC)
